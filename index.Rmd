This practical workshop will consist of a generic introduction to using the R language for data science followed by an introduction to the [Bioconductor project](https://www.bioconductor.org/), which provides packages useful for bioinformatics.

During the workshop we will be using R on a server we run. However R is free, and you can install it on your own computer. There are two things to download and install:

* [Download R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

(R is the language itself. RStudio provides a convenient environment in which to use R.)

## Further reading

This book fills in further details about using Tidyverse packages:

* ["R for Data Science" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

Bioconductor is a moving target, so books you find may be out of date. We recommend reading vignettes of relevant packages. Various workshop materials and publications are available to provide an overview.
